## What it is

A minimalist canvas with familiar tools (draw, erase, fill, clear) plus an experimental **tracking mode** that lets you guide a floating cursor using subtle movement. Start/stop drawing at any time while tracking stays on.

---

## Basic functions

- **Freehand drawing** with adjustable color and brush size  
- **Erase** precisely with a controllable brush  
- **Fill** closed regions with your chosen color  
- **Straight lines** from the last point (hold a modifier and click)  
- **Undo / Redo** recent changes  
- **Export** your work as a PNG

---

## Tracking mode

Turn on tracking to control a visible cursor with gentle motion and choose when to **Start** or **Stop** drawing. You can tune **Sensitivity** and **Line Blending** however feels most comfortable.

> Motion processing runs in your browser; no video is recorded or stored.
